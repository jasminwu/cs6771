# Week 1 Notes

## 1.1 Introduction

### const keyword
Suggests that a value cannot be modified. Good practice to use this keyword unless you know you will be modifying the value.

### References
A reference is an alias for an existing variable. It is declared by using the `&` operator. It is used to pass variables by reference to functions. This is useful when you want to modify the value of a variable in a function.

Similar to a pointer, but cannot be null and cannot be reassigned. Do not need to use `->` or `*` to access members of a reference.


### Insertion in STL containers
In C++, emplace and push are methods used to add elements to various container classes, such as std::vector, std::deque, std::list, and others. While both methods are used for inserting elements, they have some key differences:

    Type of Elements:
        push_back (or push_front for some containers) is used to add a copy of the provided element to the container.
        emplace_back (or emplace_front for some containers) constructs an element in-place within the container using the provided arguments.

    Arguments:
        push_back and push_front take the actual value (an object of the container's value type) that you want to insert.
        emplace_back and emplace_front take constructor arguments necessary to create a new element of the container's value type.

    Efficiency:
        emplace methods can be more efficient than push methods when constructing complex objects, as they avoid unnecessary copy or move operations. When using emplace, you directly provide the arguments needed to construct the element, and the container constructs it in-place.
        push methods require the creation of a temporary object, which may involve copying or moving the provided object, and then inserting that temporary object into the container.
