# Week 1 Notes

## C++ Basics

### const keyword
Suggests that a value cannot be modified. Good practice to use this keyword unless you know you will be modifying the value.

### References
A reference is an alias for an existing variable. It is declared by using the `&` operator. It is used to pass variables by reference to functions. This is useful when you want to modify the value of a variable in a function.

Similar to a pointer, but cannot be null and cannot be reassigned. Do not need to use `->` or `*` to access members of a reference.


### Insertion in STL containers
In C++, `emplace` and `push` are methods used to add elements to various container classes, such as `std::vector`, `std::deque`, `std::list`, and others. While both methods are used for inserting elements, they have some key differences:

1. Type of Elements:
    - `push_back` (or `push_front` for some containers) is used to add a copy of the provided element to the container.
    - `emplace_back` (or `emplace_front` for some containers) constructs an element in-place within the container using the provided arguments.

2. Arguments:
    - `push_back` and `push_front` take the actual value (an object of the container's value type) that you want to insert.

    - `emplace_back` and `emplace_front` take constructor arguments necessary to create a new element of the container's value type.

3. Efficiency:
    - `emplace` methods can be more efficient than push methods when constructing complex objects, as they avoid unnecessary copy or move operations. 
        
    - When using `emplace`, you directly provide the arguments needed to construct the element, and the container constructs it in-place.

    - `push` methods require the creation of a temporary object, which may involve copying or moving the provided object, and then inserting that temporary object into the container.

Example code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

struct MyStruct {
    int x;
    std::string str;
    
    MyStruct(int x, const std::string& str) : x(x), str(str) {}
};

int main() {
    std::vector<MyStruct> vec;

    // Using push_back (copy constructor is called)
    MyStruct obj1(1, "Hello");
    vec.push_back(obj1);

    // Using emplace_back (constructor is called in-place)
    vec.emplace_back(2, "World");

    for (const MyStruct& elem : vec) {
        std::cout << elem.x << " " << elem.str << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Declaring vs Defining
Declaring a variable/function means that you are telling the compiler about it. 

Defining a variable/function means that you are telling the compiler to allocate memory for it. 


### Explicit type conversion
We use the `static_cast` operator to convert between types. This is a safer alternative to C-style casting.

### Default arguments
Default arguments are used to provide a default value for a function parameter. If the argument is not provided, the default value is used.

Example code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

void print(int x, int y = 10) {
    std::cout << x << " " << y << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    print(1, 2); // 1 2
    print(1); // 1 10

    return 0;
}
```


### Function overloading
Function overloading is when multiple functions have the same name, but different parameters. 

The compiler will choose the correct function to call based on the parameters provided. 

Note that the return type must be the same for all overloaded functions. 


### Overload resolution
Overload resolution is the process of selecting the correct function to call when multiple functions have the same name.
