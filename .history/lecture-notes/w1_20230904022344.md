# Week 1 Notes

## 1.1 Introduction

### const keyword
Suggests that a value cannot be modified. Good practice to use this keyword unless you know you will be modifying the value.

### References
A reference is an alias for an existing variable. It is declared by using the `&` operator. It is used to pass variables by reference to functions. This is useful when you want to modify the value of a variable in a function.

Similar to a pointer, but cannot be null and cannot be reassigned. Do not need to use `->` or `*` to access members of a reference.


### Using .emplace for containers
Instead of using `.push_back()` or `.push_front()` to add an element to a container, you can use `.emplace()` to construct the element in place. 

In other words, the emplacement function avoids constructing and destructing temporary objects.
